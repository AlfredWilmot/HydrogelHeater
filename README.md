# Modular PCBs

One _UI PCB_ with all the temperature/current sensing circuitry, as well as UI peripherals (LCD, rotary encoder, speaker?) will be made with all the necessary breakouts. 
This _UI PCB_ will mount onto MCU-specific shield PCBs; thereby enabling ease of inegration of new MCU platforms.
